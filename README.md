## This project is an exploratory data analysis of the Google Play Store dataset. The objective of this analysis is to gain insights into the app market on the Google Play Store.

# Data Set
The Google Play Store dataset used for this analysis contains information on over 10,000 apps available on the Google Play Store. The dataset includes details such as the app category, ratings, reviews, installs, and price. The data was sourced from Almabetter and can be found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l8N817gzFaZ1xeifDx2s_YXXtM2HnjDd/view?usp=share_link

# Technologies Used
## The analysis was performed using Python 3.8, and the following libraries: 
* pandas 
* numpy 
* matplotlib 
* seaborn. 

# Methodology
The following steps were taken to perform the EDA on the data set:

**Data cleaning**: The dataset was cleaned by removing duplicates and null values.

**Data exploration**: The dataset was explored by analyzing the distribution of app categories, ratings, reviews, installs, and price.

**Data visualization**: The insights gained from the exploration were visualized using various plots such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.

# Results
The following insights were gained from the EDA:

The most popular app categories on the Google Play Store are family, game, and tools.

Most apps on the Google Play Store have a rating of over 4.

The number of installs is positively correlated with the rating of the app.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, the EDA on the Google Play Store dataset provided insights into the app market on the Google Play Store. The analysis revealed that the most popular app categories are family, game, and tools, and most apps have a high rating. The number of installs is also positively correlated with the rating of the app. However, it is important to note that this analysis has some limitations, and further research is needed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the app market on the Google Play Store.
